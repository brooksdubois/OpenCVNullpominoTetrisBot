OpenCV Nullpomino Tetris Bot
----------------------------

This project is meant to use computer vision to play nullpomino for you. It is a work in progress, and as of this writing only capable of playing of playing a few lines in tetris before topping out.

### Requirements

This project will spin up a window that needs to be lined up with the green rectangle over the nullpomino 150 lines marathon next piece. For now, it only supports this game which should run in Swing and be fully playable. It reads the screen and detects the playfield, so pay attention to how the windows are aligned. To actually get it to play you'll need to start the opencv app and then quickly start a new game in tetris.
